      "question": "The projection of line is always ______ to it's actual line ?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Greater than or equal",
        "b": "Less than or equa",
        "c": "Greater",
        "d": "Smaller"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "A projection is always equal to or shorter than the actual line due to foreshortening.",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "If line is situated in HP then its projection in vp?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Lies at some distance from xy",
        "b": "Lies parallel to xy",
        "c": "Lies in xy"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "A line in HP lies directly on the XY line in the VP projection.",
      "difficulty": "beginner"

    {
      "question": "If a line is 40mm long and is inclined at 30° from hp and parallel to VP then its projection in HP is?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "34.64mm",
        "b": "20mm",
        "c": "30.76mm",
        "d": "40mm"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanation": "The top view (HP projection) = 40 × cos(30°) = 34.64mm.",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "If the projection of a line is a point in HP. It means?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Line is parallel to both HP and VP",
        "b": "Line is perpendicular to HP and parallel to VP",
        "c": "Line is perpendicular to VP and parallel to HP"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanation": "A line perpendicular to HP appears as a point in its top view.",
      "difficulty": "beginner"
    },
    {
      "question": "If a line is in VP, which view from the following gives the actual length of the line AB??",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Top view",
        "b": "Side view",
        "c": "Front view",
        "d": "40mm"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanation": "Since the line lies in VP, the front view shows its true length.",
